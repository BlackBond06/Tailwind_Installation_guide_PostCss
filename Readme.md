This is an installation guide for setting up tailwind to a project using PostCSS.

Introduction:
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for creating modern designs quickly. By utility-first, it means Tailwind provides a set of predefined classes which applys a single style. For example, lets say a background property is needed in 3 div elements, one way to accomplish this would be to create 3 classes for each div element and apply the background property to each of them.
