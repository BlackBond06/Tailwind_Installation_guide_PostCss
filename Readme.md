                            TAILWIND INSTALLATION WITH POSTCSS
/****************************************************************************************/
This is an installation guide for setting up tailwind to a project using PostCSS.

Introduction:
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for creating modern designs quickly. By utility-first, it means Tailwind provides a set of predefined classes which applys a single style. For example, lets say a background property is needed in 3 div elements, one way to accomplish this would be to create 3 classes for each div element and apply the background property to each of them. This is not a proper way to use CSS. An Ideal way to use CSS in this regard would be to create 1 class, apply the needed background property and reuse in any element that requires this style.

This is the approach that Tailwind CSS uses. Tailwind CSS uses a massive portfolio of classes for almost any style a web project would need making modern designs easy to create and fast.

There are 3 ways to install Tailwind for use in a project:

1.Using CDN Link   /** Note this not suitable for production **/
2.Using PostCSS 
3.Using Tailwind CLI
